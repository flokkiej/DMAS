\subsection*{Experimental findings}

From the experiment we expect to see a segregation between the agents. Agents sharing the same emotion will bond together in groups. In these groups coalitions will form. The agents in these coalitions will cooperate with each other to form a unified profit. Members of the coalition will vote for agents of the coalition to decide cooperation or defection. This will result in growth of the coalition if outside agents agree, i.e. are ``nice'' to the coalition, or undermining if the outsider abuses the coalition. With the addition of emotions, the coalitions' bonding will become weaker. They are most likely more sensitive to change. Compared to the classical spatial prisoners dilemma, this is a less stable and robust situation.

\subsection*{Interpretation of findings}
Something something social interactions.
